title: "About Me"
description: |
     In May 2018, I graduated cum laude from Loyola University Chicago's [Interdisciplinary Honors Program](https://www.luc.edu/honors/) with a BA in economics & a BS in statistics. In May 2019, I will graduate from an [accelerated graduate program](https://www.luc.edu/math/bsmsstats/) with an MS in applied statistics. A few of the topics I've mastered through my coursework include regression analysis, predictive analytics, computational simulation & modeling, labor market analysis, econometric methods, and international monetary policy. Despite having no formal web development experience, I've decided to create & curate this website as a professional portfolio to illustrate my value as a self-starter, a lifelong learner, & a curious analyst. This website was created using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, RStudio's [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Radix](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/09/19/radix-for-r-markdown/)  web formatting, & many other tools, most of which I have mastered independent of my studies. I have a passion for passion for healthcare, technology, & the outdoors.
